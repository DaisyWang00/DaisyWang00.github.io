I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in Computer Science at [the University of Texas--San Antonio](https://www.utsa.edu). I earned my Ph.D degree in Computer Science from Southern Methodist University under the supervision of Dr. Chen Wang, and my Master’s degree in Engineering and Computer Science from Syracuse University.

My research interests include Cybersecurity and Privacy, Mobile Sensing, Augmented and Mixed Reality (AR/MR) and AI in Healthcare. I lead the **Cy**bersecurity, **P**rivacy, and **He**althcare Lab (CypherLab).

Openings
======
I am seeking self-motivated PhD students to join CypherLab, with opportunities beginning in Fall 2026 or Spring 2027. Preference will be given to students with prior research experience in mobile sensing or digital healthcare and strong software development skills. CypherLab also welcomes research intern students.

Please contact me with your resume and use the subject line format: “PhD Application + Your Name.” If you are applying as an intern student, please use the subject line format: “Intern Application + Your Name.”
