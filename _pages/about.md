I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in Computer Science at [the University of Texas--San Antonio](https://www.utsa.edu). I earned my Ph.D degree in Computer Science from Southern Methodist University under the supervision of Dr. Chen Wang, and my Master’s degree in Engineering and Computer Science from Syracuse University.

My research interests include Cybersecurity and Privacy, Mobile Sensing, Augmented and Mixed Reality (AR/MR) and AI in Healthcare.Here is my CV.

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured Markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various Markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

For those users that need more advanced functionality, the template also supports the following popular tools:
- [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for mathematical equations
- [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) for diagraming
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/) for plotting
